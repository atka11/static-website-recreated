                    Yeah, you could go to a normal school and feel safe... Or you could come here where we will actively throw you in life-threatening situations!

                    We will ease you in gently, where you will enjoy the delights of backfiring spells exploding in your face. From there, we will progress you to fighting an assortment of dangerous creatures. You may even get the opportunity to risk your life against huge dragons for sport! Cool as, right?
